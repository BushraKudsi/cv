  <h3><strong>About me:</strong></h3>
  <p>Since I was a child, I had a big interest in games and technology in which helped me a lot in improving my English and feeding my imagination.<br> I wanted to dive more into the world of games, so I started taking (Unity and Unreal Engine)
    online courses, and that also helped me develop my programming skills.
    My huge interest in technology has also led me to be always seeking for knowledge and success in my life, and this encouraged me to start taking Adobe online courses for: Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator, AfterEffects, Premiere and Adobe XD in
    addition to Sony Vegas Pro and Photography.
    <br>After I have finished my high school, I have received a scholarship to study in Japan, and that was a whole new experience that helped me strengthen my communication skills and develop a better understanding of the world
